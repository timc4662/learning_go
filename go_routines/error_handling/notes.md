# Some notes on error handling

* Errors should be first class and a feature of the system not an after thought
* What should they contain
  * cause (what happened)
  * when and where
  * user message
  * more info? -> link to log inc stack trace
* 
  

  See the context_rather_than_done for a basic example.
