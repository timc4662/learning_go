This repo contains lots of example programs created, or messed with whilst learning Go.

This folder contains code from playing with go routines whilst working through the book "Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Real-World Go Programming"

Further examples are from the Concurrency in Go book also from O'Reilly. I've either copied the code from there, to mess with, or coded up something similar whilst working through these books.
